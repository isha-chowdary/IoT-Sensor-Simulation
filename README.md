# IoT Sensor Simulation

**Simulated Temperature Sensor Readings**

---

## Overview
This project simulates a simple IoT temperature sensor generating readings over time.  
It saves the simulated data to a CSV file for further analysis or visualization.

---

## Features
- Simulate temperature sensor readings every second
- Generate 20 readings (customizable)
- Save readings with timestamps to `temperature_data.csv`
- Ready for further analysis or visualization
